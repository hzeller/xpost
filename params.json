  "body": "## Xpost\r\n\r\nXpost is a cross-platform interpreter for the PostScript Language\r\nwritten in C. It has autotools for building on unix systems, and\r\nVisual C solutions for building on Windows. Currently, a windows\r\nbuild cannot run because there's no installer to coordinate the \r\nlocation for the postscript-language data files that are needed.\r\n\r\nWe have determined that the interpreter runs \"too slow\". So we've \r\nswitched gears (from stalled-out on adding features) to\r\nOptimizing! It's no longer premature.\r\n\r\nThe core of the interpreter was written by M Joshua Ryan (luser droog).\r\nThe autotools build system, logging system, and win32 device were \r\nwritten by Vincent Torri. Individual files bear the copyright of their\r\nrespective contributors.\r\n\r\nXpost has rudimentary graphics support. MS Windows or X11 windows.\r\nPGM or PPM file output. Or a nulldevice, which executes the drawing\r\noperations and discards the output. A Raster device is in development\r\nwhich will yield the image data in BGR, BGRA, ARGB, or RGB byte orders\r\nto a calling program which uses xpost as a library component.\r\n\r\nXpost is currently distributed with a BSD-3-Clause licence which may\r\nallow its use in projects where Ghostscript is not available.\r\n\r\nThe entire interpreter is implemented as a library which is used\r\nby a relatively small application file /src/bin/xpost.c. A simpler\r\nexample of using the libary is in /src/bin/xpost_client.c.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Installation Instructions.\r\n----- ------------ -------------\r\n\r\nCurrently the intepreter source is in src/bin and the commands\r\n\r\n    ./autogen.sh   # (or ./configure if autogen.sh has already been launched)\r\n    make\r\n\r\nwill create the interpreter binary xpost(.exe)? in src/bin.\r\n\r\n    make install\r\n\r\nwill install the application, so xpost can be run as a command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany more installation and configuration options desribed in ./INSTALL.\r\n",
