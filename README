Xpost is cross-platform interpreter for the PostScript Language.

The core of the interpreter was writtern by M Joshua Ryan (luser droog).
The autotools build system, logging system, and win32 device were 
written by Vincent Torri. Individual files bear the copyright of their
respective contributors.

Xpost has rudimentary graphics support. MS Windows or X11 windows.
PGM or PPM file output. Or a nulldevice, which executes the drawing
operations and discards the output. A Raster device is in development
which will yield the image data in BGR, BGRA, ARGB, or RGB byte orders
to a calling program which uses xpost as a library component.

Xpost is currently distributed with a BSD-3-Clause licence which may
allow its use in projects where Ghostscript is not available.

The entire interpreter is implemented as a library which is used
by a relatively small application file /src/bin/xpost.c. An simpler
example of using the libary is in /src/bin/xpost_client.c.
