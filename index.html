          Xpost
        </h2>

        <p>
          Xpost is a cross-platform interpreter for the PostScript Language
          written in C. It has autotools for building on unix systems, and
          Visual C solutions for building on Windows. Currently, a windows
          build cannot run because there's no installer to coordinate the
          location for the postscript-language data files that are
          needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have determined that the interpreter runs "too slow". So we've
          switched gears (from stalled-out on adding features) to
          Optimizing! It's no longer premature.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core of the interpreter was written by M Joshua Ryan (luser droog).
          The autotools build system, logging system, and win32 device were
          written by Vincent Torri. Individual files bear the copyright of their
          respective contributors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Xpost has rudimentary graphics support. MS Windows or X11 windows.
          PGM or PPM file output. Or a nulldevice, which executes the drawing
          operations and discards the output. A Raster device is in development
          which will yield the image data in BGR, BGRA, ARGB, or RGB byte orders
          to a calling program which uses xpost as a library
          component.
        </p>

        <p>
          Xpost is currently distributed with a BSD-3-Clause licence which may
          allow its use in projects where Ghostscript is not
          available.
        </p>

        <p>
          The entire interpreter is implemented as a library which is used
          by a relatively small application file /src/bin/xpost.c. A simpler
          example of using the libary is in /src/bin/xpost_client.c.

        <p>Quick Installation Instructions.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Currently the intepreter source is in src/bin and the commands</p>

        <pre><code>./autogen.sh   # (or ./configure if autogen.sh has already been launched)
            make
        </code></pre>

        <p>will create the interpreter binary xpost(.exe)? in src/bin.</p>

        <pre><code>make install
        </code></pre>

        <p>will install the application, so xpost can be run as a command.</p>

        <p>
          Many more installation and configuration options desribed
          in ./INSTALL.
